Other pertinent information or parameters? If extra credit is allowed and if instructors are supposed to make grade book changes to accommodate the extra credit, provide a link to the <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-9940-415278195" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How do I give extra credit in a course?</a> tutorial.]</span></p>

<p>For auto-enrolling groups, please check the group enrollment and make any manual adjustments which might be necessary before students complete group activities. To edit any type of enrollment, please follow the instructions in the "<a href="http://byu-idaho.screenstepslive.com/s/14177/m/53637/l/496507-how-do-i-add-students-to-a-group-or-edit-group-size" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How Do I Add Students to a Group or Edit Group Size?</a>" tutorial, making note of the CAUTION at the top of the page.</p>

<h2>Course Maintenance</h2>
<h3>Fixes</h3>
<p>A fix is a correction to errors in course content or design that may have appeared due to human error. Even though errors may be identified by any instructor, many fixes will need approval by the online course representative (OCR) before they are implemented. The OCR is familiar enough with both course function and design to recognize and know the proper fix for mechanical and content errors. Examples of fixes include broken links, date changes, grammar/spelling errors, and audio/video issues.</p>
<p>To submit a fix ticket, use the&nbsp;'Reques Help' link located in the help menu on the left menu panel of Canvas. Once a ticket is received, Course Support employees will update the reference course for next semester. You might need to make the corrections to your current section. Course Support and your OCR can help you make those corrections, if needed.</p>
<h3>Improvements</h3>
<p>An improvement is a suggested change that did not exist in the initial design of the course. It requires review by and approval from the course lead (CL) and the OCR before Course Support can implement it in the course. These changes are usually large-scale and frequently require more time to implement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have ideas for improving an assignment, instructions, grading rubric, groups, etc., please send your idea to your OCR for consideration. Please do not make these changes in your section, as they need to be discussed by the course council. Those ideas which are approved and authorized will then be implemented in the course.</p>

<h2>Course Visit&nbsp;Considerations</h2>
<p>The table below notes any unique course features and their impact on your instructor assessments/TGL course visits. If the course activities fall within normal instructor guidelines, the "Norm" column will be checked in the table below. If a course contains any unique elements which detract from your ability to meet instructor expectations, they will be noted in the "Course-specific Notes" column.</p>
<p><span style="color: #cc0000;">[Add "X"s to the Norm column or make notes in the Course-specific Notes column, as needed to describe the course. This information will be used by supervisors&nbsp;as they conduct their classroom visits and check on instructor progress in the course. Examples of activities which need to be described in the "Course-specific Notes" include discussion boards in which the instructor should not participate, assignments that will take more than one week to grade, etc.]</span></p>
